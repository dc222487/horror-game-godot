A 3d immersive horror game with pathfinding enemy AI using Godot game engine 
This is a personal project so I will update when I have time.
~~Note that the enemy AI right now can be glitched and get stuck in static bodies, I am trying to find a solution for this without switching game engines since godot pathfinding for 3D is a bit clunky~~
Fixed the ai pathfinding so now it doesnt get stuck 90% of the time...I am sure there are still some spots that the ai can get stuck on
